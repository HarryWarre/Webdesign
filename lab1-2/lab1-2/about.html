        <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Burpee</dt>
            <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance.
                Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands
                forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
            </dd>
            <dt>Plank</dt>
            <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a  push up position and rest your forearms on the floor.
                Hold the position as long as you can.
            </dd>
            <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
            <dd>Mountain climbers are a good ardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch
                as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a moutain)
            </dd>
