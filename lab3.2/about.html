                    <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                    <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Burpee</dt>
                        <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance.
                            Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands
                            forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Plank</dt>
                        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a  push up position and rest your forearms on the floor.
                            Hold the position as long as you can.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good ardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch
                            as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a moutain)
